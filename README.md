# Leaflet Challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with visualizing earthquake data in the world by making API calls from a website using geoJSON.

I personally chose Significant Earthquakes in the Past 7 Days for my pull, as the instructions said we could pick whichever one we preferred.

Building the code for the pull was my code, I had a lot of help from my tutor, David Chao in making the functions for the markers.
